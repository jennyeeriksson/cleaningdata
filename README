In this project, a tidy data set it produced that averages accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from smart watches. The data is summarized per individual user and the activity the user performed (i.e running, walking, standing etc).

# Files
TidyData.txt - The tidy data set that contains average accelerometer and gyroscope signals per user and avtivity
codebook.md - Describes all features in TidyData.txt
run_analysis.R - The script that produces TidyData.txt
raw_data - A catalog containing the raw data, including descriptive files

# Information
The data set TidyData.txt is produced by running the script run_analysis.R, which will extract data from the raw_data catalogue and compute the average movement signals per user and activity.

# Instruction
1. Clone this repo
2. Run run_analysis.R with R version 3.6.3 
3. Inspect each accelerometer/gyroscope average signal per user and activity, as noted by the column names.
